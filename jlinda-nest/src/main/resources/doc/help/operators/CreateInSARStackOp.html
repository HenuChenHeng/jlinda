<h3>Create InSAR Stack</h3>

<p>
    Create InSAR Stack is a component of the <a href="../tutorials/insar_coregistration.html"> interferometric
    coregistration processing chain</a>. The <i>Create InSAR Stack</i> Operator collocates two spatially overlapping
    SAR products.
</p>

<p><br>
    When number of products are collocated, slaves product are subset-ed into the SAR geometry of the master product.
    In order to establish a mapping between the master and the slave, either orbits and timing information is used, or
    annotated geographical position grids. The algorithm requires reasonable accurate orbital or geopositioning
    information for both master and slave products.
</p>

<p><br>
    In simple terms this operator can be interpreted as a coarse (1st-level) coregistration between the master and
    slave(s) products, based on orbit or geo-information, and that instead of resampling repositioning and subset-ing of
    slave images is performed. Importantly, after stacking operation is performed, the reference SAR geometry of
    the stack is the one of master.
</p>

<h4>Operator Parameters</h4>

<p>
    The following parameters are used by this operator:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Master Band:</b> All bands (real or virtual) of the selected products are listed. User can select master
        bands (for real image). Note that i and q bands for complex image are automatically pre-selected.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Slave Band:</b> All bands (real or virtual) of the selected product. User can select
        one number of slave products. For complex data, i and q bands are automatically pre-selected.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Initial Offset Method:</b> It specifies the method used for the offset computation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Find Optimal Master:</b> Selection of the optimal master based on the <a href="InSARMaster.html"> InSAR Stack
        Overview</a> procedure.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The user may choose between two methods for computation of the initial offsets:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Orbit method</b>, described in somewhat detail in implementation notes;
    </li>
    <li><b>GCPs method</b>, this method is similar to the one implemented in <i>Create Stack
        Operator</i> of NEST and not described in detail here. It is not removed because of legacy reasons.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> For interferometry the Orbit method is recommended. The Orbit based method is less effected by
    sometimes erroneous GCP annotations. Especially with missions where the quality of GCP annotations would change
    throughout the lifetime of the mission, e.g., ERS 1/2 satellite data.
</p>

<h4>Implementation Notes</h4>

<p>
    The algorithm used for computation of offset between the master and slave images consists of three steps:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        For the approximate center (line,pixel) of the input master image, compute the position (x,y,z in the system of
        the orbits) of the reference point P on a reference surface (i.e., ellipsoid).
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the Doppler equation, the position of the slave satellite that corresponds to the reference point P is
        computed, and also compute the (line, pixel) coordinates in the slave system.
    </li>
    <li>
        The offset between master and slave image is defined as the difference between (line,pixel) coordinates of the
        reference point P in the master and slave SAR coordinate system. Note that for the offset
        <i>"slave minus master"</i> semantics is used.
    </li>

</ol>
