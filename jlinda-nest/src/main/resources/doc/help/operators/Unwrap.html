<!--<h3>Phase Unwrapping in NEST: Interface to SNAPHU</h3>-->

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    The principal observation in radar interferometry, is the two-dimensional relative phase signal, which is the
    2pi-modulus of the (unknown) absolute phase signal. The forward problem, the wrapping of the absolute phase to the
    [-pi,pi) interval is straightforward and trivial. The inverse problem, the so-called <strong>phase
    unwrapping</strong>, due to inherent non-uniqueness and non-linearity, is one of the main difficulties and
    challenges in the application of radar interferometry.
</p>

<p>
    There are many proposed techniques to deal with the phase unwrapping problem. The variable phase noise,
    as well as the geometric problems, i.e., foreshortening and layover, are the main causes why many of the proposed
    techniques do not perform as desired. Furthermore, any of the given phase unwrapping techniques will not give a
    unique solution, and without additional a-priori information, or strong assumptions on the data behaviour, it is
    impossible to assess the reliability of the solution.
</p>

<h3>Phase Unwrapping in NEST</h3>

<p>
    There are two methods to perform the phase unwrapping in NEST: 
    
<ol>
    <li>
        Using integrated phase unwrapping functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using 3rd party software.
    </li>

</ol>
    
<h4>Integrated phase unwrapping</h4>

<p>
    NEST version 5, brings the internal implementation of the phase unwrapping functionality. As all other 
    interferometric functionality, the unwrapping support, is provided via 
    <a href="https://github.com/ppolabs/jlinda/">jLinda</a> library.  
</p>

<p>
    This unwrapping implementation is following the concept introduced by Costantini, [1]; where the unwrapping 
    problem is formulated and solved as a minimum-cost flow problem on a network. 
</p>

<p>
    Because of the framework restrictions, the unwrapping in NEST is performed as a two-stage process. First, the 
    initial unwrapping is performed with the unwrap operator, results need to be saved, and then in a 
    second stage, the unwrapping result is <i>stitched</i> into a smooth result. Specifically:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt><a href="UnwrapOp.html">Uwrap</a></dt>
    <dd>
        First an independent unwrapping of tiles is performed using the Uwrap operator, and importantly, results need 
        to be saved.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="StitchOp.html">Stitch</a></dt>
    <dd>
        As a second step, independently unwrapped tiles are integrated using the Stitch operator. This operator 
        <i>stitches</i> the unwrapped phases of all tiles to form a complete smooth image of unwrapped phase.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Interface to 3rd party software: SNAPHU</h4>

<p>
    To obtain the unwrapped interferogram, a 3rd party software should be used. The recommended tool to perform the
    phase unwrapping is the "Statistical-Cost, Network-Flow Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping" (SNAPHU), that can be
    downloaded from <a href="http://www-star.stanford.edu/sar_group/snaphu/">SNAPHU project web-page</a>. The restricted
    distribution license of this software prevented a direct integration in NEST, so from the user it is expected to
    download and install this, or other, 3rd party software for the phase unwrapping individually.

<h5>SNAPHU support tools</h5>

<p>
    To make integration between NEST and SNAPHU as easy as possible, we developed a set of tools for
    exporting and importing data to/from SNAPHU. It should be <strong>noted</strong> that these tools are developed for
    the user convenience and that the same functionality can be achieved with chaining Product Generation Tools
    of NEST (eg. Band Arithmetic, Replace Metadata, and other operations), and manual construction of SNAPHU
    configuration files.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt><a href="SnaphuExportOp.html">SNAPHU export</a></dt>
    <dd>
        The graph for exporting NEST InSAR data to processing with SNAPHU, building SNAPHU configuration file, and
        creating a "phase" product. The phase product serves as a container an interface with SNAPHU. In the phase
        product the wrapped phase is saved, with the corresponding metadata.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="SnaphuImportOp.html">SNAPHU import</a></dt>
    <dd>
        The importing (ingestion) of data in previously created "phase unwrapping" container product. With importing
        the unwrapped phase, the existing wrapped phase data in the phase product is replaced with unwrapped phase,
        while preserving the metadata of the unwrapped product, or the phase product is extended with the unwrapped
        phase band.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Recommendations, guidelines and notes</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>Multilooking and Phase Filtering</dt>
    <dd>
        In order to obtain an optimal results of unwrapping it is recommended to multi-look (i.e., square) and phase-filter 
        (i.e., increase signal-to-noise and smooth) input interferogram.
    </dd>
    <dt>Quality of unwrapping</dt>
    <dd>
        The quality and reliability of unwrapped results very much depends on the input coherence. If the input 
        coherence is low, the user should <u>NOT</u> a reliable unwrapping results. For example, if an input 
        interferogram is coherent only in some areas (e.g., "coherence islands"), the reliable results can be expected
        only in those areas. Also see the next note, on InSAR being relative technique. 
    </dd>
    <dt>Interpretation of unwrapped results</dt>
    <dd>
        The interferometry is a <i>relative technique</i>, i.e., gives difference between pixels, rather than the 
        absolute values. Thus the unwrapped results should also be interpreted as a relative. For example, 
        height/displacement between two pixels is a relative height/displacement between those two pixels. To obtain 
        absolute estimates, a tie point can be used, or assumptions on the signal. For correcting, and making results 
        of unwrapping absolute a BandMaths operator can be used.
    </dd>
